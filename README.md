# Competency-Based Assessment in Classroom

**Brief Details of the Project** 

In this work, an online competency-based assessment technique is proposed to understand the competency  level  of  students  in  the  classroom.  The  proposed  web  interface [(https://assessmentofcompetence.web.app)](https://assessmentofcompetence.web.app/)  helps  the  teachers/trainers  to  understand  and evaluate the competency level of individual students on a  particular topic once the class will be concluded.  

Competency-based  learning  can  detect  the  level  of  teaching  as  well  as  the  level  of  gained knowledge by the learners. 

There are four stages in competency learning  

- Unconscious Incompetence 
- Conscious Incompetence 
- Conscious Competence 
- Unconscious Competence 

**Unconscious Incompetence:** In Unconscious Incompetence, learners do not know about the topic after getting the lecture in the classroom from teachers.  They do not know that they are not aware of topics, even they do not have any experience on the particular topic as well. There is a knowledge gap from the side of learners and the learner is unaware of it. 

**Conscious Incompetence:** In this conscious competence level, learners come to know about the knowledge gap and also realize the need for required learning from trainers or teachers on the particular subject topic. Therefore a knowledge gap exists and the Learner is aware of it. 

**Conscious Competence:** In Conscious Incompetence, learners know about the skill and gain knowledge of how to perform after getting perfect learning or training. He can do things on that skill  set and  proper understanding, for  becoming  expert  learners  realize there  is  a  need  of effective practice.  

**Conscious  Incompetence:**   In  conscious  incompetence,  the  learners  are  quite  skilled  and knowledgeable  and  they  are  seeking  new  challenges  for  growing  themselves.  There  is  no knowledge gap as well as the learner is quite experienced about it.

The Web Interface helps you to make assessments easily and helps you to acknowledge the understanding level of the learner. Our Web Application allows you to create an account for the application. After successfully signing up you can log in and create a quiz and you can generate a quiz link and share the links with the learner so that they can attempt the quiz. The end of the quizzing interface will give you an analysis of the Quiz. 

There are two sides of this Web Application **Admin Side**(Teacher side) and **Learner side**  

On the Admin Side, you need to log in or Sign up first. After login, you will come to the Dashboard Section.

` `On the learner side when the learner visits the link there will be a start quiz button to start the quiz you have to press the button then instructions will be shown to you. Once the learner completes reading the instructions, press next then the quiz will start. There will be MCQ-based questions. Once the learner selects an option it will show a Dropdown Menu asking for your competency level. To go to the next question you have to select one of the 4 options. Then only you go for the next question.
